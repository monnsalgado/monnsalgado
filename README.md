## Hey, I'm Moserrat Salgado 👩🏻‍💻

I'm a UX Designer, working in a consulting and research company that specializes in helping organizational leaders to establish innovation strategies **focused on the customer/user experience** to design and develop better products and services.
#### Now I'm willing to learn about fullstack programmig on a bootcamp 👾



These are a few commands I found interesting from the first class of the bootcamp, that can be useful or work as a *starter pack* when using the terminal.

|Command|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|_pwd_| shows current directory|
|_mkdir_|   makes new directory |
|_cd_  |    change directory|
|_clear_  | clear terminal|
|_ls_  | list files |

|Command alias| Description|
|------------|--------------|
|**alias rm="trash"** | To avoid deleting files permanently|
|**alias npms="npm start"** | Indicates to node package manager to run "start" command|
